            The South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) was established in 2002. SAEON has a network of stations, both terrestrial and marine,
            around South Africa. These stations have instruments that regularly measure a variety of phenomena, like temperature and rainfall,
            in a number of offerings, like actual, cumulative, in a number of units, like °C and mm, that are saved in a database as observations.

            You can test the @Html.ActionLink("API", "Index", "Help", new { area = "" }, null) using <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>.
            You can use the built-in OAuth2 authorization using the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Auth URL: https://identity.saeon.ac.za/connect/authorize</li>
                <li>Access Token URL: https://identity.saeon.ac.za/connect/token</li>
                <li>Client ID: SAEON.Observations.WebAPI.Postman</li>
                <li>Client Secret: Postman</li>
                <li>Scope: SAEON.Observations.WebAPI</li>
                <li>Grant Type: Client credentials</li>
            </ul>
            You can then use the returned token in your calls.
