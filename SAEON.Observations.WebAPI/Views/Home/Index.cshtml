            The South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) was established in 2002. SAEON has a network of stations, both terrestrial and marine,
            around South Africa. These stations have instruments that regularly measure a variety of phenomena, like temperature and rainfall,
            in a number of offerings, like actual, cumulative, in a number of units, like °C and mm, that are saved in a database as observations.

            You can access these observations through this @Html.ActionLink("API", "Index", "Help", new { area = "" }, null). You need to have registered on
            the <a href="http://observations.saeon.nimbusservices.co.za">Observations Database</a> site. Once you have an account you can use 
            <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> to test the API. You can do a post to the
            <a href="https://observationswebapi.saeon.nimbusservices.co.za/oauth2/connect/token">token endpoint</a> 
            to get an OAuth2 bearer token that you need to use for authorization in your API calls. The post needs the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
                <li>grant_type: client_credentials</li>
                <li>username: (the email address you registered)</li>
                <li>password: (the password you registered)</li>
                <li>client_id: SAEON.Observations.WebAPI</li>
                <li>client_secret: 81g5wyGSC89a</li>
                <li>scope: SAEON.Observations.WebAPI</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will get something back like this:<br />
            {<br />
            "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6ImVhbWFaY2ZCTVRiOW9V",<br />
            "expires_in": 25200,<br />
            "token_type": "Bearer"<br />
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            When you call the API you need to add an Authorization header like this:<br />
            Authorization:bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6ImVhbWFaY2ZCTVRiOW9V<br />
            Content-Type:application/json
